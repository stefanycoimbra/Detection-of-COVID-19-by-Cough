# Detection-of-COVID-19-by-Cough


## An Introduction About the Project

The general idea of our model is detect anomalys in the cough of the users, the input data should be captured by one microphone contained in the pcb of our Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, then this data will be process using different types of filters and techniques of dsp (digital signal processing) then this modifyed data should enter the model to be process and give us a result, if the user has covid or not. In this study, we intended to build a model that detects if the person has Covid-19 or is a Healthy one.
